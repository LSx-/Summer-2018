Hw 13:
hw 13 is to make the Matrix2 and Vector2 classes

*finished*
Hw14A:
homework A is to test out the Matrix2 and Vector2 classes
input: Enter point X,Y and a angle (in degrees)
output: "The point (X,Y) rotated by (angle) is (answer)"

*finished*
HW14B:
homework B is to make the Matrix3 and Vector3 classes

*finished*
HW14C:
homework C is to test out the Matrix3 and Vector3 classes
input: Enter point (X,Y) and a translation (P,Q)
output: "Translating (X,Y) by (P,Q) gives you (U,V)" //(U,V) = answer

*finished*
HW15A:
Homework A is editing the Matrix3 class so that it can take 2 Matrices
and dot product them together to get a giant matrix. also doing something
called makeTransform, which will actually do alot of the math for us
that we had to do in homework 14a and homework 14c (mainly 14c)

*finished*
Hw15B:
Homework b is actually testing there stuff out with a new program!
this program will test out the rotation and also the translation
at the same time!! but not only that, there are 2 different ways you can
write it out and get the same output, so for this homework we test out
both ways and we have to see if it actually works
