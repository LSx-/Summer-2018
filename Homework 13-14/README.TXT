Hw 13:
hw 13 is to make the Matrix2 and Vector2 classes

Hw14A:
homework A is to test out the Matrix2 and Vector2 classes
input: Enter point X,Y and a angle (in degrees)
output: "The point (X,Y) rotated by (angle) is (answer)"

HW14B:
homework B is to make the Matrix3 and Vector3 classes

HW14C:
homework C is to test out the Matrix3 and Vector3 classes
input: Enter point (X,Y) and a translation (P,Q)
output: "Translating (X,Y) by (P,Q) gives you (U,V)" //(U,V) = answer
