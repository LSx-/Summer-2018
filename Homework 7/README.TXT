HW7A:
Hw7a is the Derivative Program!
 * we will take only 1 input from the user!
 * after we take there input we will then split it
 * and take out the "*x^" and put the numbers in an array
 * after that we will parse them out of the array and do the 
 * math needed to get out right answer
 * 

HW7B:
 Hw7b is the Anti-Derivative Program!
 * we will take only 1 input from the user!
 * after we take there input we will then split it
 * and take out the "*x^" and put the numbers in an array
 * after that we will parse them out of the array and do the 
 * math needed to get out right answer

HW7C:
Hw7C is the area Program but to an exact number!
 * here we will take a function, start point, and end point from the user
 * after all of that we will do the area program but all with 
 * anti-derivative helping us out! to get a more exact number
