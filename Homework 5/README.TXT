Welcome to the equation of plane program!
Here you will take in inputs for point P, Q, and R.
After that we will println out the equation of the plane!

HW5B:
Hw5b is the point of intersection program.
the user will input 10 different values. with those values
we will do some calculations to get the point of intersection
and print out that info
