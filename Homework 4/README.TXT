HW4A:
Hw4a is a program that will take inputs from the user via a scanner
that will fill in point P (p1,p2) and Q (q1,q2). with that information
we will make the program calculate the points to get the vector and then with
that vector we will get points on a line when we do a for loop for T

HW4B:
Hw4b is a program that will take inputs from a user via a Scanner.
 * once the user inputs the Vector (s1,s2) and a point (p1,p2),
 * we will then ask them to input the a point(r1,r2) that they would like to check for!
 *
 * after all the inputs the program will then calculate it
 * T will only go up to 10 (from 0)

HW4C:
Hw4c is actually a program for the Cross product
 * in Multivariable Math! We will take the input from the user for
 * v1,v2,v3,w1,w2 and w3. after taking all the information, we will then 
 * turn that into vectors for i,j,and k. after we do the calculations for
 * i,j, and k, we will turn it into 1 big vector called n
