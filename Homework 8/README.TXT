HW8A:
Hw8a will is a deriv and a antiDeriv program with
 * Sin and Cos. We will take the input from the user
 * (just 1 line) and then we will split the input string
 * and give back the deriv and the anti deriv as the output

HW8B:
Hw8b is a program where we will see if the input has a antiDerivative form!
 * we will take the input of a Derivied function and then see if it can go backwards
 * the function must contain a cos or sin for it to work, once supplied with one 
 * we see if it has a form and let them know what the form is
